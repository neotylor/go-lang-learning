# 🔁 Control Structures – Go Language

Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your Go programs. This section covers conditional logic and loops using examples.

## 🧠 Overview

Control structures are fundamental for decision-making and repetition in programming. In Go, the most commonly used control structures include:

- `if`, `else`, and `else if`
- `switch`
- `for` loops (Go’s only looping construct)

## 📂 Examples

| Concept     | Description                  | Code Link          |
|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| If-Else      | Conditional branching        | [if-else.go](./if-else.go)     |
| For Loop     | Iterating over values/counts | [for-loop.go](./for-loop.go)   |
| Switch       | Cleaner multiple conditionals| [switch.go](./switch.go)       |

Each file contains:
- Simple, clear Go code examples
- Inline comments for learning
- Output to understand behavior

## ▶️ How to Run

Run any example by navigating to this folder in your terminal and using:

```bash
go run <filename>.go
````

For example:

```bash
go run if-else.go
```

> Make sure Go is installed. Need help? Check the [installation guide](../02-installation/README.md)

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Use `if-else` statements for decision-making
* Use `switch` for multiple condition branches
* Create and control `for` loops (including `while`-like behavior)

Let me know if you want to break this into a folder (like `notes and programs`), or if you need visuals or flowcharts to embed in the README.
