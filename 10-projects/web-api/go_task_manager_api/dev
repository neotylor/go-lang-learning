-------------------------------------





Would you like me to:


* Add a new `/me/details` route that fetches user from DB?
* Document all response fields more explicitly using a Go struct instead of `map[string]interface{}`?
* Add failure tests (e.g. no token or invalid token)?
* Add support for returning full user info (by querying DB using username)?

Would you like to:

* Structure this token response into a shared `models.AuthResponse`?
* Or return user info (`username`, `id`) along with the token?

//////Post development/////////
Would you like to:

* Or auto-fetch full user details from DB (not just username)?
* Add a `/me/details` that fetches full user info from DB using the `userID`?
* Add role-based access later using `role` claim in token?
* Add failure cases (invalid token, missing token)?
* Or refactor JWT middleware to use custom types (e.g. `type ContextKey string`) for cleaner context handling?


* Implement role-based access (e.g. admin-only routes)?

* Email validation next?
* A password strength validator (e.g. must include digits/symbols)?

* Apply the same pattern to `Task` validation?
* Or refactor error handling into a shared helper for consistent JSON error responses?


* Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs?
* Add basic authentication?
* Or move to Dockerizing this app?



// Unit Test Files
* Add tests for `taskService`?
* Mock the DB with `gorm.io/gorm/logger` and `sqlmock` for isolated unit testing?
* start writing tests for this endpoint?
* create unit tests for your API?
* To test invalid login attempts
* To test protected routes using the returned token

* Restrict CORS to specific domains for production?

### âœ… Next Step:

* Or to add these to a CI workflow (like GitHub Actions)

### ðŸ”§ Next Steps:


Would you like me to summarize all the testable endpoints and help you create a full test coverage plan?
Would you like me to help you create a similar centralized initializer for middleware or services next?
