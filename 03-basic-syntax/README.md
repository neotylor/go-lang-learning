## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with the classic **Hello, World!** program:
- 📄 [hello-world.go](./hello-world.go)

This simple example shows the basic structure of a Go program, including:
- Package declaration
- Importing packages
- The `main` function
- Printing output to the console

## 🧠 Notes and Examples

Go deeper with concept-based folders under [`notes and programs`](./notes%20and%20programs):

| Concept            | Description                                | Code Link                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| First Program       | Hello World in a structured project folder | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/01_first_program/main.go) |
| Variables           | Declaring & using variables                | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/02_variables/main.go)     |
| Print Statements    | Output using `fmt`                         | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/03_print/main.go)        |
| User Input          | Accepting input from the terminal          | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/04_user_input/main.go)   |
| Functions           | Defining and calling functions             | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/05_functions/main.go)    |
| Error Handling      | Handling basic errors                      | [main.go](./notes%20and%20programs/06_error_handling/main.go) |

You’ll also find:
- 📄 Markdown notes for each topic (`variables.md`, etc.)
- 🧪 Practice examples to run and modify

## ▶️ Running an Example

Navigate into any folder and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

> 📌 Make sure Go is properly installed. If not, refer to the [installation guide](../../02-installation/README.md).
