	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	println("Numbers:", numbers) //Numbers: [5/5]0xc00000c3c0

	println("Updated Numbers:", numbers) //[20/20]0xc000018140


The output lines:

```
Numbers: [5/5]0xc00000c3c0
Updated Numbers: [20/20]0xc000018140
```

are **not** from the `fmt.Println()` calls — they're from the `println()` function, which is a low-level Go built-in, unlike `fmt.Println()`. Let's break this down:

---

### 🔹 `println("Numbers:", numbers)`

You're calling `println` with a string and a **slice**. The `println` built-in function is very limited — it only supports a few types (e.g., `string`, `int`, `float64`, etc.), and when used with **complex types like slices**, it just prints the slice's **internal representation**, which looks like:

```
[<length>/<capacity>] <memory address>
```

---

### ⚙️ So what does this mean?

#### 👉 `Numbers: [5/5]0xc00000c3c0`

* **`[5/5]`**:

  * `5` is the **length** of the slice (number of elements).
  * `5` is the **capacity** (underlying array size).
* **`0xc00000c3c0`**:
  This is the memory address of the underlying array that the slice references.

#### 👉 `Updated Numbers: [20/20]0xc000018140`

After appending many elements (`append(numbers, 6, 7, ..., 20)`), Go **automatically creates a new underlying array** with increased capacity, and copies the original elements into it.

* Now the slice has:

  * Length = 20
  * Capacity = 20
  * A **new memory address** (`0xc000018140`) — the old array was no longer big enough.

---

### 🆚 Why does `fmt.Println()` behave differently?

```go
fmt.Println("Numbers:", numbers)
```

This **prints the actual contents** of the slice in a human-readable format:

```
Numbers: [1 2 3 4 5]
```

because `fmt.Println()` knows how to format slices.

### ✅ Summary

| Call                               | Output Format                  | Explanation                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `println("Numbers:", numbers)`     | `[length/capacity]0x<address>` | Internal slice representation (Go built-in) |
| `fmt.Println("Numbers:", numbers)` | `[1 2 3 4 5]` or similar       | Actual contents of the slice                |
