# 📘 Go Slice Example – Learning Slice Basics

This simple Go program demonstrates the basics of working with **slices** in Go, including:

* Creating a slice
* Printing contents
* Checking length and type
* Appending elements
* Understanding how slices are stored internally

---

## 🧠 What Is a Slice?

A **slice** in Go is a dynamic, flexible view into the elements of an array. Unlike arrays, slices can grow and shrink. Internally, a slice holds:

* A pointer to the underlying array
* Its length
* Its capacity (size of the backing array)

---

## 📄 Code Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start Slice learning")

    // Create a slice of integers
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

    // Low-level print (not recommended for slices)
    println("Numbers:", numbers) // Output: [5/5]0xc00000c3c0

    // Recommended print using fmt
    fmt.Println("Numbers:", numbers) // Output: [1 2 3 4 5]

    // Print the type of the slice
    fmt.Printf("Numbers array (Slice) Type: %T\n", numbers) // Output: []int

    // Print the length of the slice
    fmt.Println("Numbers's array length:", len(numbers)) // Output: 5

    // Append more elements to the slice
    numbers = append(numbers, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)

    // Low-level print again (not recommended)
    println("Updated Numbers:", numbers) // Output: [20/20]0xc000018140

    // Print updated slice contents
    fmt.Println("Updated Numbers:", numbers)

    // Print updated type (still []int)
    fmt.Printf("Updated Numbers array (Slice) Type: %T\n", numbers)

    // Print updated length
    fmt.Println("Updated Numbers's array length:", len(numbers)) // Output: 20
}
```

## 🔍 Output Explanation

### `println("Numbers:", numbers)`

This uses Go’s **low-level built-in `println` function**, which doesn't print the actual contents of slices. Instead, it prints:

```
[<length>/<capacity>] <memory address>
```

Examples:

* `[5/5]0xc00000c3c0` — A slice with 5 elements and capacity 5
* `[20/20]0xc000018140` — After appending, the slice grew and got a new backing array

Use `fmt.Println` instead of `println` for printing actual slice values.

## 📌 Key Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept            | Description                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slice declaration  | `numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`                                          |
| Print slice        | `fmt.Println(numbers)` shows the actual content                            |
| Slice type         | `fmt.Printf("%T\n", numbers)` gives the slice type: `[]int`                |
| Slice length       | `len(numbers)` returns the current number of elements                      |
| Append to slice    | `append(numbers, ...)` adds new elements, possibly changing its capacity   |
| Slice reallocation | When capacity is exceeded, a new underlying array is created automatically |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* ✅ Use `fmt.Println()` or `fmt.Printf()` for readable output
* ❌ Avoid using `println()` for complex types like slices or structs
* 🧠 Remember that `append()` may create a new backing array if capacity is exceeded

---

## 🚀 Run It

To run the program:

```sh
go run main.go
```
